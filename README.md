# Investment-Calculator
An interactive C++ application designed to teach compound interest by allowing users to model investment growth over time. The program utilizes an InvestmentCalculator class to gather, validate, and store four key inputs: Initial Investment Amount, Monthly Deposit, Annual Interest Rate, and Number of Years. After input, the application generates two comparative reports: one showing growth without any monthly deposits (interest on principal only), and a second showing growth with the user's monthly deposits. All calculations are performed using monthly compounding interest , and the user can run multiple scenarios to observe how changes in inputs impact their final investment balance.
