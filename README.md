# Investment-Calculator
  An interactive C++ application designed to teach compound interest by allowing users to model investment growth over time. The program utilizes an InvestmentCalculator class to gather, validate, and store four key inputs: Initial Investment Amount, Monthly Deposit, Annual Interest Rate, and Number of Years. After input, the application generates two comparative reports: one showing growth without any monthly deposits (interest on principal only), and a second showing growth with the user's monthly deposits. All calculations are performed using monthly compounding interest , and the user can run multiple scenarios to observe how changes in inputs impact their final investment balance.
  The core problem solved was providing high school students with an interactive, visual tool to compare investment strategies. I structured the program using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, housing all data and logic within the InvestmentCalculator class. I'm particularly proud of the robust input validation (GetValidatedInput), which securely handles non-numeric inputs and range checks, preventing application crashes. The dual reporting feature, reusing the core CalculateAndPrintReport function by passing in either a zero or the user's monthly deposit, was a clean and efficient design choice. However, I recognize that the fixed column widths using std::setw() could make the reports less adaptable, and I will enhance error handling by explicitly using try-catch blocks around the setter methods for maximum security and user-friendliness in future development.
  The most challenging part of this project was correctly implementing the nested loop logic for the monthly compounding calculation, ensuring the balance and annual interest accumulated precisely over 12 months for the Year-End report . I overcame this by diligently following the project's pseudocode and the specified interest formula, verifying that variables like currentBalance and yearEndEarnedInterest were updated at the correct loop level. Moving forward, I plan to add the C++ fmt Library to my support network for superior output formatting and study advanced exception handling techniques. The skills gained—especially OOP encapsulation, secure input validation, and translating complex mathematical formulas into code—are directly transferable to nearly all future coursework and professional projects, making this a highly foundational assignment.
